# Explaination

So, I decided to create a separate notes on folder. I have decided make each subtopic a folder as well. I am starting with C and I want to include sub-folders for executable files and whatnot.

# TOC

- [C](c/notes.md)
- [C++](cpp/notes.md)
- [JavaScript](javaScript/notes.md)
- [React](react/notes.md)
- [React Native](react-native/notes.md)
- [Express](express/notes.md)
